      <h3>IP - how to determine an IP address </h3>
      <p>Networks, and the internet, don't identify computers (of any size, even your smartphone) by the name you give
        them. Computers prefer numbers, and the numbers they use as identifiers are called IP addresses.</p>
      <p>The "IP" stands for "internet protocol," which is part of Transmission Control Protocol/internet Protocol
        (TPC/IP). It's all called IP for short, and TCP/IP is the language used for communication by most networks.</p>
      <p>When it comes to your computer(s), there are actually several IP addresses involved. One is how the computer
        talks to the internet at large, which is the IP address of your&nbsp;<a
          >router</a>. That IP address is generally assigned
        to the router by your internet service provider (ISP); the router, in turn, handles all the traffic from your
        computer out to the internet. So even though a website only sees a request come in from the IP address on the
        router, the router knows how to route the information to/from the computer. (That's why it's called a router.)
      </p>
      <p>Computers on the internal networks, be it Wi-Fi or Ethernet, at home or in the office, have their own IP
        addresses assigned to them (usually by the router). That way, all the nodes on the internal network can also
        communicate. The protocol used by the router to assign IP addresses is called Dynamic Host Control Protocol
        (DHCP).</p>
      <p>If you have an IP address assigned, it's typically considered a "dynamic IP" because it could be temporary; the
        router might give the node in question a different IP address at a later time (same with the IP address your ISP
        gives your router). However, you can set up "static IP addresses" on computers so they never change&mdash;this
        can be important for some kinds of network communications, especially if it's crucial to be able to find that
        same node over and over. You could also get a static IP for your router&mdash;which is handy if you run a web
        server, for example, but expect your ISP to charge extra.</p>
      <p>IP addresses are typically in the same format as a 32-bit number, shown as four decimal numbers each with a
        range of 0 to 255, separated by dots&mdash;each set of three numbers is called an octet. This format is used by
        IP version 4 (or IPv4). With it, you could&mdash;in theory&mdash;have 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255 out there.
        However, this limited the world to a possible 4+ billion IP addresses, which isn't enough.</p>
      <p>So now, there's IPv6, which is 128-bit, with eight groups of four hexadecimal digits (numbers and lower-case
        letters mixed), all separated by a colon (for example: 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334). That offers a
        lot more than 4 billion addresses. The actual number is a 34 with 37 zeros after it (or 2 to the
        128th&nbsp;power), which is technically 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,455. That's a lot of
        addresses.</p>
